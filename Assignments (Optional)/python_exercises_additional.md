        # Initialize the library
        pass
        
    def add_book(self, title, author, year, genre):
        # Add a book to the library
        pass
    
    def search_books(self, query):
        # Search for books by title or author
        pass
    
    def checkout_book(self, book_id):
        # Mark a book as checked out
        pass
    
    def return_book(self, book_id):
        # Mark a book as returned
        pass
    
    def generate_report(self):
        # Generate a formatted report about the library
        pass

# Test your library system with sample data
